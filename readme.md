#### Hello World! ðŸ¤–


A good database design is crucial for a high-performance application. Just like you wouldn't start building a house without the benefit of a blueprint, you need to think about how your data will be stored beforehand. Taking the time to design a database saves time and frustration later, and a well-designed database ensures ease of access and retrieval of information. While choosing a design, a lot of considerations must be accounted for. process, store, and organize data in an efficient way. structure data through normalization and present your data with views.

#### This repository involves the following topics:

* Database design taking into consideration two approaches for data processing OLTP & OLAP and getting familiar with the different forms data can be stored.

* Implement star and snowflake schemas, recognize the importance of normalization, and see how to normalize databases to different extents.

* Create and query views. On top of that, manage them and end by identifying the difference between materialized and non-materialized views.

* Database management-related topics. Grant database access based on user roles, how to partition tables into smaller pieces, what to keep in mind when integrating data, and which DBMS fits your business needs best.
